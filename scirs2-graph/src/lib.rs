//! Graph processing module for SciRS2
//!
//! This module provides graph algorithms and data structures
//! for scientific computing and machine learning applications.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - Basic graph representations and operations
//! - Graph algorithms (traversal, shortest paths, etc.)
//! - Network analysis (centrality measures, community detection)
//! - Spectral graph theory
//! - Support for graph neural networks
